# Cards JS

Welcome to the cards-js readme, if you're reading this you're probably interested in working as a developer at PerfectPitchTech. We're excited to meet you, but first we have fun coding challenge for you to complete.

## Rules

1. **DO NOT** make a pull request back to this repository with your solution (otherwise other people can see your solution).
2. Your solution needs to be written in **Javascript.** Feel free to use any Javascript libraries or frameworks you feel are appropriate. (React solutions will have bonus points!)

## Requirements

The task is to write a program that draws cards from a deck. This program needs to keep drawing cards from the deck until it has drawn a **QUEEN** of every suit.

Once you've drawn all of the **QUEENS** please display the results of the draw in the following way.

* Show all of the cards that were drawn for each suit, and sort the cards by value (Aces are high)
  - example: Hearts: [2, 3, Jack, Queen]

### Constraints:

* Use the following API as the interface for getting a deck of cards and drawing those cards https://deckofcardsapi.com/
* **Never** draw more than **1** card per second

### Tips

* We appreciate a good designs, so feel free to use design libraries like https://github.com/pakastin/deck-of-cards
* Don't write all from scratch use some cool libraries like https://github.com/therewillbecode/react-poker

## Finished?

Please send your solution to your contact at PerfectPitchTech and we'll be in touch with your from there. Thanks and happy coding.
